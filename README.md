# Ninja-Brawl-Online
An online web browser game in which users connect to the game immediately on loading to the website. 
Players play as a ninja attempting to hit and kill other players using a sword that rotates according to the mouse position 
in the game to add to their score.



Please note that the game currently only runs on localhost:3000 however it may be published online using technologies such as ngrok
to tunnel the localhost connection to broadcast it on a certain url. If you wish to test it locally, simply open 2 windows in the browser connecting to localhost:3000 after running the server file using the command in the command prompt: node server.js.
